- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented from clear requirements
- [ ] Test plan is defined
- [ ] Operational readiness criteria is defined
- [ ] Graduation criteria for dev preview, tech preview, GA
- [ ] User-facing documentation is created in [openshift-docs](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/)

## Summary

The goal of this enhancement proposal is to allow Windows nodes to consume and use global egress proxy configuration
when making external requests outside the cluster's internal network. OpenShift customers may require that external
traffic is passed through a proxy for security reasons, and Windows instances are no exception.

There already exists a protocol for publishing 
[cluster-wide proxy](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html) 
settings which is consumed by different OpenShift components (Linux worker nodes and infra nodes, CVO and OLM managed 
operators); Windows worker nodes do not currently consume or respect proxy settings. This effort will work to plug this
feature disparity by making the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) proxy aware at install time and reactive during
runtime.

## Motivation

The motivation here is to expand the Windows containers production use case, enabling users to add Windows nodes and run 
workloads easily and successfully in a proxied cluster. This is an extremely important ask for customer environments
where Windows nodes are often tasked with pulling images from secure registries or making requests to off-cluster
services, and those that use a custom public key infrastructure.

### Goals

* Create an automated mechanism for WMCO to consume global egress proxy config from existing platform recources.
  Includes:
  + proxy connection information (http/https URLs)
  + additional certificate authorities required to validate the proxy's certificate
  + list of networks that should bypass the proxy (no-proxy hostnames, domains, IP addresses or other network CIDRs)
* Configure the proxy settings in WMCO-managed components on Windows nodes (kubelet, containerd runtime)
* Pick up changes to the cluster-wide proxy settings during cluster runtime
* Maintain normal functionality in non-proxied clusters

### Non-Goals

* Anything to do with *ingress* or reverse proxy settings is out of scope
* Monitor or automatically replace expired CAs in the cluster's trust bundle or Windows components

### User Stories

User stories can also be found within the node proxy epic: [WINC-802](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WINC-802)

#### Story 1 - [WINC-637: Set cluster-wide proxy environment variables on Windows instance](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WINC-637)

As an administrator of a network with strict traffic egress policies,
I want Windows nodes on my OpenShift cluster to successfully make proxied
external requests for images and other external service interactions.
This includes updating proxy settings when the cluster-wide config changes.

#### Story 2 - [WINC-633: Support custom CA certificates for cluster-wide proxy](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WINC-633)

As an administrator of a network using a man-in-the-middle proxy which
is performing traffic decryption/re-encryption, I want to provide valid
CAs that can trust my proxy's certificate to Windows nodes so they and
their workloads will trust my proxy.

#### Story 3 - [WINC-688: Update Proxy certs on Windows instances when the certs are rotated](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WINC-688)

As an OpenShift administrator, I want user-provided proxy CA certificates 
to be automatically updated on Windows nodes when I manually rotate them 
in cluster-wide resources so that Windows nodes use the latest trust bundle
and outbound traffic continues to respect proxy settings.

## Proposal

This is where we get down to the nitty gritty of what the proposal
actually is. Describe clearly what will be changed, including all of
the components that need to be modified and how they will be
different. Include the reason for each choice in the design and
implementation that is proposed here, and expand on reasons for not
choosing alternatives in the Alternatives section at the end of the
document.

### Workflow Description

Explain how the user will use the feature. Be detailed and explicit.
Describe all of the actors, their roles, and the APIs or interfaces
involved. Define a starting state and then list the steps that the
user would need to go through to trigger the feature described in the
enhancement. Optionally add a
[mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid#readme) sequence
diagram.

Use sub-sections to explain variations, such as for error handling,
failure recovery, or alternative outcomes.

For example:

**cluster creator** is a human user responsible for deploying a
cluster.

**application administrator** is a human user responsible for
deploying an application in a cluster.

1. The cluster creator sits down at their keyboard...
2. ...
3. The cluster creator sees that their cluster is ready to receive
   applications, and gives the application administrator their
   credentials.

#### Variation [optional]

If the cluster creator uses a standing desk, in step 1 above they can
stand instead of sitting down.

See
https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/workload-partitioning/management-workload-partitioning.md#high-level-end-to-end-workflow
and https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/agent-installer/automated-workflow-for-agent-based-installer.md for more detailed examples.

### API Extensions

API Extensions are CRDs, admission and conversion webhooks, aggregated API servers,
and finalizers, i.e. those mechanisms that change the OCP API surface and behaviour.

- Name the API extensions this enhancement adds or modifies.
- Does this enhancement modify the behaviour of existing resources, especially those owned
  by other parties than the authoring team (including upstream resources), and, if yes, how?
  Please add those other parties as reviewers to the enhancement.

  Examples:
  - Adds a finalizer to namespaces. Namespace cannot be deleted without our controller running.
  - Restricts the label format for objects to X.
  - Defaults field Y on object kind Z.

Fill in the operational impact of these API Extensions in the "Operational Aspects
of API Extensions" section.

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints [optional]

What are the caveats to the implementation? What are some important details that
didn't come across above. Go in to as much detail as necessary here. This might
be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.

### Risks and Mitigations

What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate. Think broadly. For
example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger OKD
ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed and by whom?

Consider including folks that also work outside your immediate sub-project.

### Drawbacks

The idea is to find the best form of an argument why this enhancement should
_not_ be implemented.  

What trade-offs (technical/efficiency cost, user experience, flexibility, 
supportability, etc) must be made in order to implement this? What are the reasons
we might not want to undertake this proposal, and how do we overcome them?  

Does this proposal implement a behavior that's new/unique/novel? Is it poorly
aligned with existing user expectations?  Will it be a significant maintenance
burden?  Is it likely to be superceded by something else in the near future?


## Design Details

### Open Questions [optional]

This is where to call out areas of the design that require closure before deciding
to implement the design.  For instance,
 > 1. This requires exposing previously private resources which contain sensitive
  information.  Can we do this?

### Test Plan

**Note:** *Section not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?
- What additional testing is necessary to support managed OpenShift service-based offerings?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy. Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation and anything particularly
challenging to test should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations).

### Graduation Criteria

**Note:** *Section not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, or as something else. Initial proposal
should keep this high-level with a focus on what signals will be looked at to
determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this
enhancement:

- Maturity levels
  - [`alpha`, `beta`, `stable` in upstream Kubernetes][maturity-levels]
  - `Dev Preview`, `Tech Preview`, `GA` in OpenShift
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning),
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general, we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless how the functionality is accessed.

[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

**If this is a user facing change requiring new or updated documentation in [openshift-docs](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/),
please be sure to include in the graduation criteria.**

**Examples**: These are generalized examples to consider, in addition
to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Dev Preview -> Tech Preview

- Ability to utilize the enhancement end to end
- End user documentation, relative API stability
- Sufficient test coverage
- Gather feedback from users rather than just developers
- Enumerate service level indicators (SLIs), expose SLIs as metrics
- Write symptoms-based alerts for the component(s)

#### Tech Preview -> GA

- More testing (upgrade, downgrade, scale)
- Sufficient time for feedback
- Available by default
- Backhaul SLI telemetry
- Document SLOs for the component
- Conduct load testing
- User facing documentation created in [openshift-docs](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/)

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
end to end tests.**

#### Removing a deprecated feature

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing feature
- Deprecate the feature

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure this
is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade in order to keep previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade in order to make use of the enhancement?

Upgrade expectations:
- Each component should remain available for user requests and
  workloads during upgrades. Ensure the components leverage best practices in handling [voluntary
  disruption](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/). Any exception to
  this should be identified and discussed here.
- Micro version upgrades - users should be able to skip forward versions within a
  minor release stream without being required to pass through intermediate
  versions - i.e. `x.y.N->x.y.N+2` should work without requiring `x.y.N->x.y.N+1`
  as an intermediate step.
- Minor version upgrades - you only need to support `x.N->x.N+1` upgrade
  steps. So, for example, it is acceptable to require a user running 4.3 to
  upgrade to 4.5 with a `4.3->4.4` step followed by a `4.4->4.5` step.
- While an upgrade is in progress, new component versions should
  continue to operate correctly in concert with older component
  versions (aka "version skew"). For example, if a node is down, and
  an operator is rolling out a daemonset, the old and new daemonset
  pods must continue to work correctly even while the cluster remains
  in this partially upgraded state for some time.

Downgrade expectations:
- If an `N->N+1` upgrade fails mid-way through, or if the `N+1` cluster is
  misbehaving, it should be possible for the user to rollback to `N`. It is
  acceptable to require some documented manual steps in order to fully restore
  the downgraded cluster to its previous state. Examples of acceptable steps
  include:
  - Deleting any CVO-managed resources added by the new version. The
    CVO does not currently delete resources that no longer exist in
    the target version.

### Version Skew Strategy

How will the component handle version skew with other components?
What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- During an upgrade, we will always have skew among components, how will this impact your work?
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and
  in the kubelet? How does an n-2 kubelet without this feature available behave
  when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI, CRI
  or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.

### Operational Aspects of API Extensions

Describe the impact of API extensions (mentioned in the proposal section, i.e. CRDs,
admission and conversion webhooks, aggregated API servers, finalizers) here in detail,
especially how they impact the OCP system architecture and operational aspects.

- For conversion/admission webhooks and aggregated apiservers: what are the SLIs (Service Level
  Indicators) an administrator or support can use to determine the health of the API extensions

  Examples (metrics, alerts, operator conditions)
  - authentication-operator condition `APIServerDegraded=False`
  - authentication-operator condition `APIServerAvailable=True`
  - openshift-authentication/oauth-apiserver deployment and pods health

- What impact do these API extensions have on existing SLIs (e.g. scalability, API throughput,
  API availability)

  Examples:
  - Adds 1s to every pod update in the system, slowing down pod scheduling by 5s on average.
  - Fails creation of ConfigMap in the system when the webhook is not available.
  - Adds a dependency on the SDN service network for all resources, risking API availability in case
    of SDN issues.
  - Expected use-cases require less than 1000 instances of the CRD, not impacting
    general API throughput.

- How is the impact on existing SLIs to be measured and when (e.g. every release by QE, or
  automatically in CI) and by whom (e.g. perf team; name the responsible person and let them review
  this enhancement)

#### Failure Modes

- Describe the possible failure modes of the API extensions.
- Describe how a failure or behaviour of the extension will impact the overall cluster health
  (e.g. which kube-controller-manager functionality will stop working), especially regarding
  stability, availability, performance and security.
- Describe which OCP teams are likely to be called upon in case of escalation with one of the failure modes
  and add them as reviewers to this enhancement.

#### Support Procedures

Describe how to
- detect the failure modes in a support situation, describe possible symptoms (events, metrics,
  alerts, which log output in which component)

  Examples:
  - If the webhook is not running, kube-apiserver logs will show errors like "failed to call admission webhook xyz".
  - Operator X will degrade with message "Failed to launch webhook server" and reason "WehhookServerFailed".
  - The metric `webhook_admission_duration_seconds("openpolicyagent-admission", "mutating", "put", "false")`
    will show >1s latency and alert `WebhookAdmissionLatencyHigh` will fire.

- disable the API extension (e.g. remove MutatingWebhookConfiguration `xyz`, remove APIService `foo`)

  - What consequences does it have on the cluster health?

    Examples:
    - Garbage collection in kube-controller-manager will stop working.
    - Quota will be wrongly computed.
    - Disabling/removing the CRD is not possible without removing the CR instances. Customer will lose data.
      Disabling the conversion webhook will break garbage collection.

  - What consequences does it have on existing, running workloads?

    Examples:
    - New namespaces won't get the finalizer "xyz" and hence might leak resource X
      when deleted.
    - SDN pod-to-pod routing will stop updating, potentially breaking pod-to-pod
      communication after some minutes.

  - What consequences does it have for newly created workloads?

    Examples:
    - New pods in namespace with Istio support will not get sidecars injected, breaking
      their networking.

- Does functionality fail gracefully and will work resume when re-enabled without risking
  consistency?

  Examples:
  - The mutating admission webhook "xyz" has FailPolicy=Ignore and hence
    will not block the creation or updates on objects when it fails. When the
    webhook comes back online, there is a controller reconciling all objects, applying
    labels that were not applied during admission webhook downtime.
  - Namespaces deletion will not delete all objects in etcd, leading to zombie
    objects when another namespace with the same name is created.
